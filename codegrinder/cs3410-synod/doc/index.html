<html><head></head><body><p>This problem will let you test and submit your Paxos synod protocol
simulator.</p>

<p>Put your code as a single file in <code>synod.go</code>. The test input scripts
are all in the <code>inputs/</code> directory. A file with the extension
<code>.input</code> is the test input, and corresponding file with extension
<code>.expected</code> has the expected output.</p>

<p>To test your code, just type &#34;make&#34;, which is short for &#34;make step&#34;.
&#34;make step&#34; will compile and run your code, feeding each of the
input files in turn. It monitors your output line-by-line and
compares it with the expected output. As soon as it detects a
mismatch, it stops and shows you what it expected and what it found.</p>

<p>Note that the input lines will also be echoed to the screen, but
your program should not print them out.</p>

<p>To pass these tests, your output must be identical to the expected
output. You may have to revise your printed messages to conform.</p>
